# R3DFEM: An R package for running the 3D-CMCC-FEM model
 Due to storage capacity, some data cannot be uploaded to Github, causing the functions make_meteo_EOBS and make_soil_ISRIC not to work.
 
 The R3DFEM package provides functions for creating and checking inputs for
 simulations, running the 3D-CMCC-FEM model, plotting inputs and outputs, and other
 functionalities. See the package readme for an overview of the package
 functionality.
 See the [official web page](https://www.forest-modelling-lab.com/the-3d-cmcc-model) for the complete documentation of the model.
